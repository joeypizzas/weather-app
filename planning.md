# Planning for weather app

## Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?

- Structure is header, body, and footer.
  - Header is title and maybe SVG?
  - Body has the main weather app portion.
  - Typical footer.
- Body has a top area to search for the weather location. Simple field with a search button and a prompt to enter, likely all on one line.
- Below that is a large card with the weather for the searched location. It will have:
  - Large text, location, temperature, forecast for that day, and some kind of weather icon for the forecast.
  - Smaller text area below that includes several items, like high and low temp, humidity, wind, UV index, pressure, etc.
- Clean UI with a nice color scheme:
  - Header background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFB347, #FFD194)
  - Main background: #FDF6EC
  - Card / container background: #FFFFFF or #FFF9F3
  - Footer background: #ECECEC
  - Primary accent: #FFB347
  - Secondary accent: #6495ED
  - Text / primary content: #2D2D2D

## How do you plan to design the application state?

## How do you plan to organize your project files?

## What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?

## Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
